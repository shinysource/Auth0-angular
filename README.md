# Auth0 and AngularJS

This AngularJS module will help you implement client-side and server-side (API) authentication. You can use it together with [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com) to add username/password authentication, support for enterprise identity like Active Directory or SAML and also for social identities like Google, Facebook or Salesforce among others to your web, API and mobile native apps. 

[Auth0](https://www.auth0.com) is a cloud service that provides a turn-key solution for authentication, authorization and Single Sign On.

# Tutorial

Create a new account in Auth0 and setup a new application.

1. There are two ways of implementing signin/singup. One is using our [Login Widget](https://docs.auth0.com/login-widget2) and the other using the [Auth0.js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js). 
    ```html
    <!-- login widget -->
    <script src="//d19p4zemcycm7a.cloudfront.net/w2/auth0-widget-2.3.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>
    ```
    _- or -_

    ```html
    <!-- auth0.js and build your own UI -->
    <script src="https://d19p4zemcycm7a.cloudfront.net/w2/auth0-1.2.8.min.js"></script>
    ```
    
2.  Add the [Auth0 Angular module](auth0-angular.js):
    ```js
    <script src="https://raw.github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/master/auth0-angular.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>
    ```

2. Include the Auth0 module as a dependency of the app main module:
    ```js
    var app = angular.module('myApp', ['auth0']);
    ```

3. Configure it with your Auth0 application information inside a `.config` section.
    ```js
    myApp.config(function ($routeProvider, authProvider) {
      ...
      authProvider.init({
        domain: 'yourdomain.auth0.com',
        clientID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
        callbackURL: 'http://localhost:1337/',
        callbackOnLocationHash: true
      });
    });
  ```

4. You can configure three routes for the Authentication flow (or just one and show/hide the login UI, whatever you prefer):
 * `/login`:  The route that will allow the user to input their credentials.
 * `/logout`: The route that the user will follow in order to close its session.
 * `/`:   A route where you are going to display some restricted content.
Add the following router configuration to the `.config` block.  

    ```js
    myApp.config(function ($routeProvider, authProvider) {
    
      ...
    
      $routeProvider
      .when('/',        { templateUrl: 'views/root.html',     controller: 'RootCtrl'    })
      .when('/logout',  { templateUrl: 'views/logout.html',   controller: 'LogoutCtrl'  })
      .when('/login',   { templateUrl: 'views/login.html',    controller: 'LoginCtrl'   })
    
      .otherwise({ redirectTo: '/login' });
    });
    ```

  > Note: We are currently using Angular's ngRoute but any other routing library can be used.

5. Inject the `auth` service in your controllers and call the `signin`/`signout` methods. 
  ```js
  myApp.controller('LoginCtrl', function ($scope, auth) {
    auth.signin();
  });
  ```

  ```js
  myApp.controller('LogoutCtrl', function ($scope, auth) {
    auth0.signout();
  });
  ```

  > More details about the parameters you can use for the [Auth0 Login Widget](https://docs.auth0.com/login-widget2) and [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js). 

6. Use the `auth.profile` object to show user attributes in the view.
  ```js
  myApp.controller('RootCtrl', function ($scope, $location, $http, auth) {

    ...

    $scope.user = auth.profile;
  };
  ```
  The template of that controller will be:
  ```html
  <div>
    <br />
    <span>Welcome {{user.name}}!</span>
  </div>
  ```

## Calling an API

Now that the user was authenticated on the client side, you want to make sure that every time an API is called, the user attributes are sent in a secure way. The `auth` service that you used before also provides a `token` which is a signed [JSON Web Token](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jones-json-web-token). This token can be sent through an HTTP header and the backedn API can validaate it without any extra roundtrip (since the token has been signed with a secret that is shared between the API and Auth0).

1. Add to you application the `authInterceptor` dependency (it's included in the same auth0-angular.js file).
    
  ```js
  var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [
    'ngCookies', 'ngRoute', 'auth0', 'authInterceptor'
  ]);
  ```

2. Use `$http` from your controller in order to make the request.
  ```js
    $http({method: 'GET', url: '/api/protected'})
      .success(function (data, status, headers, config) {
        // User authenticated, do something with the response
        ...
      })
      .error(function (data, status, headers, config) {
        ...
      });
  ```

3. If the JSON Web Token (`JWT`) has expired or has been tampered, you can handle that case here:

    ```js
        $rootScope.$on('auth:forbidden', function (event, response) {
            // handle the case where the JWT is not valid (401 status code)
            auth.signout();
            $location.path('/login');        
        });
    ```
> Note: the JWT expiration can be controlled from the Auth0 dashboard

On the backed you can use any JWT library to validate the token. Here are some:
* [ASP.NET Web API](https://docs.auth0.com/aspnetwebapi-tutorial)
* [Node.js API](https://docs.auth0.com/nodeapi-tutorial)
* [Ruby API](https://docs.auth0.com/rubyapi-tutorial)
* [PHP API](https://docs.auth0.com/phpapi-tutorial)

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**. 
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
